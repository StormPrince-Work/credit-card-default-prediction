Credit Card Default Prediction (Deep Learning + Hyperparameter Tuning)
This project builds and evaluates a deep learning model to predict whether a credit card customer will default next month. 
It focuses on handling class imbalance and systematically improving performance using data resampling (SMOTE/undersampling), class weights, and Keras Tuner Hyperband hyperparameter search.
